# Eco Calculator App
A modern Flutter application designed to help users estimate and understand their carbon footprint across various daily activities. This project provides multiple calculation modules—such as air conditioning usage, transportation, electricity consumption, and industrial fuel—to promote awareness of environmental impact through an intuitive and efficient mobile interface.

# Key Features
* Modular Calculators
Each category (e.g., Air Conditioner, Vehicle, Electric Tools) includes its own calculation page with a clean UI and structured formula inputs.
* Reusable Component Architecture
Categories are built using reusable widgets with enum-driven navigation, ensuring type safety and scalability as more calculator modules are added.
* GetX-Based Navigation
Simple and clean routing using GetX, enabling fast page transitions and lightweight state handling.

# Purpose
